# üß† Tampered Image Patch Classification with Explainability

## Overview

This project implements a **deep learning pipeline** using PyTorch to classify image patches as **original or tampered** from the CG-1050 dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training (basic CNN and ResNet-18), evaluation using metrics and Grad-CAM visualizations, and result analysis through confusion matrices and heatmaps.
